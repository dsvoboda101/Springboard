    "# The Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you've just finished the Springboard Data Science Career Track course, and have been hired by a rising popular specialty coffee company - RR Diner Coffee - as a data scientist. Congratulations!\n",
    "\n",
    "RR Diner Coffee sells two types of thing:\n",
    "- specialty coffee beans, in bulk (by the kilogram only) \n",
    "- coffee equipment and merchandise (grinders, brewing equipment, mugs, books, t-shirts).\n",
    "\n",
    "RR Diner Coffee has three stores, two in Europe and one in the USA. The flagshap store is in the USA, and everything is quality assessed there, before being shipped out. Customers further away from the USA flagship store have higher shipping charges. \n",
    "\n",
    "You've been taken on at RR Diner Coffee because the company are turning towards using data science and machine learning to systematically make decisions about which coffee farmers they should strike deals with. \n",
    "\n",
    "RR Diner Coffee typically buys coffee from farmers, processes it on site, brings it back to the USA, roasts it, packages it, markets it, and ships it (only in bulk, and after quality assurance) to customers internationally. These customers all own coffee shops in major cities like New York, Paris, London, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Berlin. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, RR Diner Coffee has a decision about whether to strike a deal with a legendary coffee farm (known as the **Hidden Farm**) in rural China: there are rumours their coffee tastes of lychee and dark chocolate, while also being as sweet as apple juice. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's a risky decision, as the deal will be expensive, and the coffee might not be bought by customers. The stakes are high: times are tough, stocks are low, farmers are reverting to old deals with the larger enterprises and the publicity of selling *Hidden Farm* coffee could save the RR Diner Coffee business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your first job, then, is ***to build a decision tree to predict how many units of the Hidden Farm Chinese coffee will be purchased by RR Diner Coffee's most loyal customers.*** \n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, you and your team have conducted a survey of 710 of the most loyal RR Diner Coffee customers, collecting data on the customers':\n",
    "- age\n",
    "- gender \n",
    "- salary \n",
    "- whether they have bought at least one RR Diner Coffee product online\n",
    "- their distance from the flagship store in the USA (standardized to a number between 0 and 11) \n",
    "- how much they spent on RR Diner Coffee products on the week of the survey \n",
    "- how much they spent on RR Diner Coffee products in the month preeding the survey\n",
    "- the number of RR Diner coffee bean shipments each customer has ordered over the preceding year. \n",
    "\n",
    "You also asked each customer participating in the survey whether they would buy the Hidden Farm coffee, and some (but not all) of the customers gave responses to that question. \n",
    "\n",
    "You sit back and think: if more than 70% of the interviewed customers are likely to buy the Hidden Farm coffee, you will strike the deal with the local Hidden Farm farmers and sell the coffee. Otherwise, you won't strike the deal and the Hidden Farm coffee will remain in legends only. There's some doubt in your mind about whether 70% is a reasonable threshold, but it'll do for the moment. \n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the problem, then, you will build a decision tree to implement a classification solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "Can you admissibly conclude anything from this scatterplot? Remember: we are trying to build a tree to classify unseen examples. Write your answer here:  This offers a much clearer conclusion.  The graph above shows a pretty clear decision boundary between these two features.  Based on where the client lands in the 2-D space between Distance and spent_last_month, it seems straightforward to predict their decision.  My concern is that I'm not sure how a decision tree would handle this since it only looks at one variable at a time and cannot draw horizontal lines in this space, but a few splits should be sufficient to recreate this decision boundary and get an accurate prediciton.\n",

Each time we run a given decision tree algorithm to make a prediction (such as whether customers will buy the Hidden Farm coffee) we will actually get a slightly different result. This might seem weird, but it has a simple explanation: machine learning algorithms are by definition ***stochastic***, in that their output is at least partly determined by randomness. \n",

Luckily, there's a method for this, known as the ***Random Forest***. \n",

Random forests are hugely powerful classifers, and they can improve predictive accuracy and control over-fitting. \n",

    "The Random Forest model produced an answer that 70% of customers (if you round up) will buy Hidden Forest coffee.  I wouldn't change my mind based on this answer for the following:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1) The Random Forest model had significantly lower accuracy scores, especially with recall.  While Random Forest might be a superior model to gini in most cases, I think the data in this project is unique in it's simplicity.  I don't see a reason to discount the result of the simpler gini tree.  \n",
    "2) In this data set, it was very clear which features we should use to build the tree: Distance and Money Spent Last Month.  While it's possible that other features could have been just as good (our EDA was too limited to decare otherwise), we knew enough to be confident in the features our gini model selected. My understanding of the Random Forest model is that adds an element of randomness to feature selection. While this is good in complex data sets, in our case it was unnecessary.  There is therefore no justification to chose the results of the Random Forest model over the gini model.\n",
    "2) Doing a new model because you don't like the answer of the first (as opposed to legitimate concerns about the accuracy of the first model) reminds me of scientists who keep re-testing p-values until they get one the eeks under 0.05 cutoff.  "
